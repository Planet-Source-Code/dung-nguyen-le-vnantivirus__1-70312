1. Manager processes :
- You can manager processes with path, ID, Icon.
- You can scan virus process whith button Scan process.
- It can call function analyzing system.
-  vnAV can detect rootkit with method detect handle. The method simple but effect.
I was tested with some sample Rootkit and some tool to hidden process.
Yeah, this software can detect it.
 
2. Manager startup :
- You can easy see programs startup.
- It auto find path, but this function have some bugs :( (Please fix help me fix it).
- With paths of programs startup, vnAV can scan startup.
- It can call function analyzing system.
- This function can recognize when 2 key UserInit error (This keys is special to staup system) and correct it.

3. Scan system :
- Auto scan memory (process) and startup
- Use signatures  ( With MD5 code) to detect virus.
- It can index to fast scan for next time.
- With more 800.000 MD5 code :)
 
4. Scan with sample :
- You only know path file of virus. With virus normal (Only copy in system and not modify it). 
+ This function can find it in process
+ In disk (With path folder you select, but i think you should select folder Windows ).
+ In registry (In keys startup).

5. Add sitgnature virus by user :
- User can add signature virus (Icon or MD5 code). This is function interesting. 

6. Auto protect :
- If you manager file in Windows Explorer, my soft can scan every fordel you use and detect if in it contain virus.
- If can auto detect have new USB disk and scan it.
